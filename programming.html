  <h2>
    Programming and Programs
  </h2>
  <br>
    I started learning to program around 5th grade when I started learning C from the Kernighan/Ritchie book. I then got interested in c++ because I found out that video games could be programmed with it. I wasn't very interested and began developing apps for iOS using xCode. I learned using a course I bought on Udemy and found it very interesting. I even did a Synopsys Science Fair project in 7th grade which was an app that you could use to manage your homework. As well as iOS, I am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop websites, like this one.
